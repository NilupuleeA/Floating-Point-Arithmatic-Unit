// IEEE_adder Module
// -----------------------------------
// Overview:
// The IEEE_adder module performs addition or subtraction on two 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.
// It handles different exponent values and aligns the significands (fractional parts) before performing the arithmetic operation.
//
// Steps in the Operation:
//
// 1. Exponent Difference Calculation:
// - Computes the difference between the exponents of the two input floating-point numbers.
// - Determines the amount of shift needed for one of the significands to align them correctly.
//
// 2. Sign and Exponent Handling:
// - Based on the exponent difference, selects the exponent to be used in the result.
// - If the exponents are equal, compares the significands to decide which numberâ€™s exponent and sign will be used in the result.
//
// 3. Significand Alignment:
// - Aligns the significands by shifting the significand of the number with the smaller exponent, so both significands are compared on the same scale.
//
// 4. Addition/Subtraction of Significands:
// - Performs the addition or subtraction of the aligned significands based on the specified operation (addition or subtraction).
//
// 5. Result Adjustment:
// - Adjusts the result to conform to the IEEE 754 format.
// - Includes normalization of the result, rounding, and potential adjustment of the exponent.
//
// 6. Output Generation:
// - Constructs the final result by combining the sign, adjusted exponent, and the resulting significand.
//
// Inputs:
// - number1, number2: 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point numbers to be added or subtracted.
// - op: Operation type (0 for addition, 1 for subtraction).
//
// Outputs:
// - result: 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point result of the operation.
//
// Details:
// This module is designed to ensure accurate floating-point arithmetic by properly handling exponent alignment,
// performing arithmetic operations, and adjusting the result according to IEEE 754 standards.
